# Beverage Company Case Study
## About Case Study
This case study is based on a fictional US beverage company introduced as a course project of ST-555, Department of Statistics, NC State  University. This company sells soft drinks, energy drinks, and flavored waters in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, along with the District of Columbia. Weekly sales data for the year 2016 is given at the county level in each state (and the District of Columbia). Quantities sold are recorded for all products, across each unit available for retail sales--individual containers and multi-bottle or can packs. These data are initially separated by product category and region, and are not always given in the same format; however, by the end of the case study, it is expected that they can all be combined into a single data source.
